# Irrlicht-Bullet-Integration
A <b>C++ Demo</b> showing how to integrate The [Irrlicht 3d](http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/) engine with [Bullet](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3) physics engine

### The demo shows the following:
- Intializing / Deintializing the Bullet physics engine
- Creating a RigidBody with collision shape.
- Creating physics constraints and joints.

### How to build:
- open the solution in Visual Studio and compile . You will need a pre-compiled bullet physics and irrlicht3d engine
### How to Use:
- Press C to drop a box.
- Press H to Create a Chain.	
- Press E to Fire a box.	
- Press space to close.
